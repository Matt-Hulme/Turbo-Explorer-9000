# The Turbo-Explorer-9000

### Project Setup

- 'yarn create turbo-explorer-9000 --template react-ts'
- 'yarn add' apollo, graphql, unocss, unocss-preset-default, --dev typescript
- Cleared out vite default files (index.css, etc.)
- Setup Simple Components

### Packages Used

- apollo/GQL: to make the queries
- UnoCss: styling and practice
- classNames: to conditionally apply styling to elements like SearchBar

### Cool Things Added

- Accounted for case-sensitivity in the SearchBar component so user didn't have to match the country capitalization exactly
- Keyboard accessible Search function (enter onKeyDown)
- Loading/Error/Empty States for both queries
- useLazyQuery for both queries since they are button-triggered queries
- Conditional classNames on searchBar to raise the SearchBar when showing results

### Cool Things Learned

- I learned you can nest ternaries to account for various error/loading/empty conditional render paths
- I learned about Keypress functionality (calling query when hitting 'Enter')
- I didn't know classNames was a package, but it is really useful with UnoCss

### Challenges Ran Into

- When first querying for CountryNamesList, I ran into case-sensitivity issues (query was expecting 'Mexico' but user input was 'mexico').
  - At first I solved this by fetching for the entire countries array, and filtering (searchTerm), then rendering that filtered array.
  - I later decided against fetching the entire CountryNamesList. While in this scenario, the dataset was small enough that I could get away with querying the entire CountryNamesList every time (without long loading times), I thought it best practice to only query for the countries where countries.name started with the search term, and used regex to convert the searchTerm input to always match what the query was expecting
- In cases where the 'CountryNameList' was only 1 country (the user types in 'mexico' for example), I wanted the CountryDetailsModal to automatically render, rather then having the user click through on a single returned card.
  - I was having a difficult time tying the 'isModalVisible' state to the 'getCountriesListData.length === 1' case., since 'isModalVisible' was a prop that existed in the child component, and I was getting some infinite looping errors.
