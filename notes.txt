    Matching global styles to how TP.com does it
    Adjusted SearchBar Stylings a bit (width/height)
    Worked on getCountryListQuery
      Wanted to do 'yarn codegen' to find the types, but setting this up seemed like a hassle, so I'm just going to hardcode them.
      Debating between useLazyQuery to fetch only upon pressing 'Go' vs having an initial 'getAllCountries' query, then the 'Go' filters the already fetched query. Probably going option 1
      Was initially not getting a value back from the getCountryListQuery
        Then I tried removing my 'search term' parameter and just returning all countries, that worked, so something must be wrong with my filter/use of search term
        Discovered that case-sensitivity was preventing me from returning the right country (was searching 'mexico' but query was expecting 'Mexico' ). Because of that, I'm going to do an initial query upon render (although not display any of these results), then lowercase all names, then the initial 'GetCountryListQuery' that uses Search Term will have no capitalization issues
          If the query was more data, I would not want to query for the entire list, but in order to avoid weird regex cases where I capitalize the first letter of every word (except for words like 'and' and 'of', etc.) in order to avoid case-sensitivity issues, I just queried for the entire list and then filtered that list.
    Now that the initial query is working, I want when clicking 'go' for the searchBar to move to the top of the HomePage, and for a panel to drop down with the results 
      Installing 'classNames' package for this
    Now I need to add the panel that displays the initial query, and add the filter that selects the correct countries
    Tried to install 'normalize' package to avoid some of these userstylesheet annoyances, but failed miserably and just added m-y-0 to work around, for example-


  12/9/23
    Deleted the 'useGetAllCountriesListQuery' and replaced with 'useGetCountriesListQuery' so that it's more optimized/doesn't fetch all of the data (even though the data is so simple that I COULD get away with this)
    Added Modal stylings/rendered the getCountryDetailsData
    Added simple loading states
    Realized my Local environment was zoomed into 150% this entire weekend so I've been styling basically everything incorrectly (((:
    Deployed to Vercel
    Added 'Enter' keypress functionality
    Had a difficult time tying the 'isModalVisible' state to the 'getCountriesListData.length === 1' case. (I want when the CountryNameList is going to only show 1 result, to just auto-open the Modal)
      Ended up not adding this functionality ^. (two different 'isModalVisible' states (one in CountryNameCard and one in CountryNameList) was making this messy)
